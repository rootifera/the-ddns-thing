# cloudflare-ddns-thing

Had enough of wrangling with those Cloudflare DDNS tools? Finding them a tad fiddly to set up? And when they do decide to cooperate, is it still a bit hit-or-miss?

Allow me to introduce you to "Cloudflare-DDNS-Thing."

"Cloudflare-DDNS-Thing" is as unreliable as any other Cloudflare DDNS tool, if not worse. You might see it making API calls here and there, experiencing the odd timeout, and failing without so much as a hint as to why. Frankly, I'm as puzzled as you are.

Anyway, give it a whirl and see how it goes!
