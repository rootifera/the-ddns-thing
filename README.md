# the-ddns-thing

Had enough of wrangling with those DDNS tools? Finding them a tad fiddly to set up? And when they do decide
to cooperate, is it still a bit hit-or-miss?

Allow me to introduce you to "The-DDNS-Thing."

"The-DDNS-Thing" is as unreliable as any other DDNS tool, if not worse. You might see it making API
calls here and there, experiencing the odd timeout, and failing without so much as a hint as to why. Frankly, I'm as
puzzled as you are.

At the moment it only supports Cloudflare. This is because Cloudflare is the only one I need.

Anyway, give it a whirl and see how it goes!
