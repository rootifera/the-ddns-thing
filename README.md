# cloudflare-ddns-thing

Are you sick of all the cloudflare ddns tools? Are they difficult to configure? Are they not working well?

Let me introduce to you, 'cloudflare-ddns-thing'. 

'cloudflare-ddns-thing' is  as bad as any other cloudflare ddns tool, if not worse. It will probably do some api calls, sometimes it will time out, sometimes it won't work and you won't even know why. I don't know either. 

Anyway, enjoy!
